      <p>Had you been interacting with an actual phishing email, cybercriminals could have obtained important user credentials and later used them to log into other company computer systems 
      without our knowledge. In the future, look out for the <strong>”Red Flags”</strong> explained below.<p/>

      <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong>The email address this was sent from was external to RMH. Had this been a real incident, the RMH IT Staff would have sent this email.</u></p>

            <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong>The email is threatening to disable the user's email account, creating a sense of urgency to click the link, which is typical of phishing emails.</p>

      <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong>The email is telling the recipient to click a link, hovering over the link shows the destination is not a legitimate Microsoft site.</p>

      <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong> Why did you receive this email? Were you expecting to receive such an email from a known business contact?</p>
      
      <h2>Thank you for participating in this security awareness training exercise. Please use the knowledge you gained to spot and report future Phishing emails!</h2>
