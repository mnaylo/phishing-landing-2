      <p>Had you been interacting with an actual phishing email, cybercriminals could have obtained important user credentials and later used them to log into other computer systems 
      without your knowledge. In the future, look out for the <strong>”Red Flags”</strong> explained below.<p/>

      <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong>The sender's email address is external to RMH. Always pay close attention to external emails to verify they are legitimate.</u></p>

            <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong>The email is creating a sense of urgency to click the link, which is typical of phishing emails. Are you actually expecting a delivery from FedEx?</p>

      <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong>The email is telling the recipient to click a link. Always examine links by hovering over the link to show the destination in an attempt to spot fraudulent links.</p>

      <p><strong>Red Flag:</strong>Did the FedEx Authentication Portal look legitimate? Fraudulent sites, quickly created for malicious purposes, sometimes look very basic in comparison to their real counterparts.</p>
      
      <h2>Thank you for participating in this security awareness training exercise. Please use the knowledge you gained to spot and report future Phishing emails!</h2>
